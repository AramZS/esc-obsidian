# Welcome to the ESC.fyi Notebook

This is where the ESC participants put interesting information, informal essays, new notes, useful links and drafts of work that will eventually make their way to the main site. 

Everything on this subdomain is in a rough/seedling state. 

## About ESC 

ESC which stands for End Surveillance Capitalism is interested in surveillance capitalism and privacy as a multi-angle problem and seeks to document the work being done in some very different spaces and forms but all intending to reshape the world into one that operates without overabundant surveillance.
