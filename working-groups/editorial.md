# Editorial Working Group 

## Charter 

The editorial working group works to turn submitted content relevant to ESC into web pages. 

The group meets via Signal, an invited group. Interested parties can submit changes or documents to members of the group who can review, give feedback, and turn pages into published works. 

## Flow of work: 

- ESC members may submit a document in any format in any of the ESC Signal channels to a member of the editorial group.
- Editorial group memebers will review, push to Obsidian, and can give feedback.
- Editorial content that is ready to publish will be tagged with front-matter saying `publishable: true`. 
- Editorial content that has undergone a review and has not been blocked by a member of the group can go live on the website as a basic page or as a more complex one, if chosen by the author. 


## AI:

- Author a recomended privacy-forward flow for submitting content and working through that content.
